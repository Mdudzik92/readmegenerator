# README Generator
  # This is an app which allows the user to answer a series of questions as input, then prints them as a usable README.md file for immediate inclusion into their projects.
  # The user will need to have Node.js on their local machine, navigate to the folder which contains this app, and run 'node index.js'
  # Answer the prompts and receive a brand new README for your project
